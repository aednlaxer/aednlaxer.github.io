Hello! I'm Alexander!

I'm an Android and Flutter developer. I started working on Android apps long time ago (I remember Ice Cream Sandwich, Action Bar Sherlock, life without Kotlin and Jetpack). Couple years ago I started looking into Flutter and now I love it!

### I love to travel

I enjoy exploring cities, tasting new food and observing nature while hiking.

Countries I've visited so far: Czechia, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Latvia, Malta, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Russia, Slovakia, Spain, Sweden, UK, Ukraine, USSR (this one doesn't exist anymore but I was born there). Can't wait to visit more cool places.

### What's "aednlaxer"?

It's my name, Alexander. I shuffled the letters in it so it became something unique.

Try yourself: <a id="nickname" href="javascript:generateNickname();">alexander</a> <small>(click to shuffle).</small>
