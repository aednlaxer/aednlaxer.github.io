Hi! I'm Alexander Troshkov, a software developer living in Helsinki, Finland.

As a software developer I mainly focus on all things Flutter. As a human, I'm interested in many other things: coffee (milkless naturally processed specialty filter coffee), bicycles (fixies and old MTB restoration projects), photography (street and urban decay), travel (visiting new cities and the ones I've already been to)â€¦

### This blog

I don't post too often but when I do I don't want to use services that prioritize revenue over content. I dislike all cookie requests, popups and what the modern web has become. 

This website is very lightweight and is built with a static site generator. There are no cookie requests, trackers and other crap. The only thing I use is GDPR-friendly Umami analytics to know how many visitors there is.

### What's "aednlaxer"?

It's my name (Alexander). I shuffled letters in it so it became something unique, searchable and nearly impossible to pronounce.

Create your own: <Aednlaxerer name="alexander"/> (click to shuffle).
